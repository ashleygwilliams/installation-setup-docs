# Updating npm

Even though npm comes with the Node.js install, npm updates more frequently than
Node.js, so you should always be updating to the newset version!

```
npm install npm@latest -g
```

You can check what version of npm you have by typing:
```
npm -v
```

To find out what a new version of npm contains, you can check the `CHANGELOG`:

- [`npm2 CHANGELOG`]
- [`npm3 CHANGELOG`]
